# Product Competitor Intelligence

## Execution

Use the bundled [Tavily CLI setup](../tavily-cli/SKILL.md) and load only the
endpoint skill needed: [search](../tavily-search/SKILL.md),
[extract](../tavily-extract/SKILL.md), [map](../tavily-map/SKILL.md),
[crawl](../tavily-crawl/SKILL.md), or [research](../tavily-research/SKILL.md).
For the connected MCP tools, use [tavily-mcp](../tavily-mcp/SKILL.md).

## Workflow

Use search and extract for product, pricing, SKU, feature, and competitor intelligence; use map or crawl for known catalogs and large competitor sites. Keep this skill focused on query construction, site navigation, source filtering, and synthesis; execution mechanics should come from companion endpoint skills.

Treat the guidance below as base guidance; adapt it to the user's request when appropriate.

- Clarify the category, competitors, geography, target customer, price band, feature set, and desired output format.
- Split broad questions into short subqueries under 400 characters: competitors, product category, pricing, alternatives, reviews, SKUs, specs, marketplaces, and recent launches.
- Search for relevant competitors, product pages, category pages, retailer listings, pricing pages, reviews, docs, and official sources.
- Filter by relevance score, domain trust, page type, and freshness before extracting.
- Extract only selected pages that can support the requested comparison, table, or brief.
- Use site mapping before broad collection on known competitor, retailer, manufacturer, marketplace, docs, or catalog domains.
- Collect multiple pages only after choosing relevant path patterns and a tight scope.

## Research Budget

- Start with a small focused search set covering competitors, category, pricing, features/specs, reviews, or launches.
- Extract only the strongest product, pricing, catalog, marketplace, docs, or review pages before drafting.
- Add more searches only for named gaps, such as missing pricing, missing SKU evidence, or missing official competitor pages.
- Do not use map unless a known competitor, retailer, manufacturer, marketplace, docs, or catalog domain needs URL discovery.
- Do not use crawl until map has identified a narrow product, pricing, category, docs, or catalog section.

## Capability Guidance

- Use search for competitor discovery, pricing checks, feature comparisons, product claims, reviews, and launch signals.
- Use extract on selected product, pricing, docs, catalog, marketplace, review, or changelog pages.
- Use map when the domain is known but the relevant product, pricing, changelog, docs, category, or catalog pages are hard to find.
- Use crawl for SKU/catalog discovery only after narrowing to relevant sections.
- Use research only when the user asks for a market report rather than product-level evidence.

## Query And Source Guidance

- Include product category, buyer segment, geography, price band, SKU/model terms, competitor names, and feature terms in separate subqueries.
- Prioritize official product pages, pricing pages, docs, catalogs, retailer listings, marketplaces, review sites, customer stories, changelogs, and credible launch coverage.
- For known sites, look for paths such as products, pricing, category, collections, docs, blog, changelog, customers, or case studies.
- Avoid irrelevant paths such as login, cart, checkout, account, admin, tag archives, and unrelated content.
- Dedupe near-identical product pages, regional variants, and syndicated listings before synthesis.
- Report failed or inaccessible sources when they affect pricing, specs, availability, or competitor coverage.

## Output Template

Use this markdown structure and adapt columns to the user's request:

```markdown
# Product And Competitor Intelligence: <category/company>

## Scope
- Category:
- Geography:
- Competitors covered:
- Source coverage limits:

## Product Comparison
| Product/SKU | Company | Category | Pricing/availability | Key features/specs | Positioning | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Competitor Notes
### <Competitor>
- Positioning:
- Product/pricing evidence:
- Strengths:
- Gaps or uncertainty:

## Market Signals
- Launches or changes:
- Review/customer signals:
- Distribution or channel signals:

## Follow-Up Searches
- <query idea>
```

Keep each claim tied to a source. Mark pricing, availability, or specs as unavailable when they are not visible.
