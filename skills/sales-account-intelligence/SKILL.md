# Sales Account Intelligence

## Execution

Use the bundled [Tavily CLI setup](../tavily-cli/SKILL.md) and load only the
endpoint skill needed: [search](../tavily-search/SKILL.md),
[extract](../tavily-extract/SKILL.md), [map](../tavily-map/SKILL.md),
[crawl](../tavily-crawl/SKILL.md), or [research](../tavily-research/SKILL.md).
For the connected MCP tools, use [tavily-mcp](../tavily-mcp/SKILL.md).

## Workflow

Use search and extract to produce fast, useful sales account context with cited sources; use map or crawl only when a known company site needs scoped navigation. Keep this skill focused on research planning, query construction, source selection, and sales-ready synthesis; execution mechanics should come from companion endpoint skills.

Treat the guidance below as base guidance; adapt it to the user's request when appropriate.

- Define the account, audience, sales motion, geography, and meeting or outreach goal.
- Split research into short subqueries under 400 characters: company overview, recent news, products, customers, leadership, funding/financials, hiring, partnerships, pain points, and relevant initiatives.
- Use search for discovery, then filter by source quality before extracting.
- Extract the strongest sources: official website, newsroom, product pages, customer stories, investor/press pages, credible news, job postings, and relevant executive profiles.
- Use site navigation when the company site is large and useful pages are hard to find.
- Collect scoped site sections only when the user needs broad coverage of customers, case studies, news, products, solutions, or careers.

## Research Budget

- Start with a small focused search set: account overview, recent triggers, product/initiative context, and buyer/pain-point evidence.
- Extract only the strongest sources before drafting the brief.
- Add more searches only for named gaps that block the brief, such as missing trigger events or missing official product context.
- Do not use map until search finds the company domain and there is a specific buried page type to locate.
- Do not use crawl for first-pass account prep unless the user explicitly asks for a site scan.

## Capability Guidance

- Use search for most account briefs, meeting prep, outreach research, and trigger-event checks.
- Use extract on selected official pages, newsroom posts, customer stories, credible news, job postings, and executive profiles.
- Use map when the company domain is known but important pages are buried.
- Use crawl for account site scans only after narrowing to sections that support the sales goal.
- Use research only when the user asks for a deep strategic account report.

## Query And Source Guidance

- Include company name, aliases, product names, executive names, industry terms, geography, and the sales motion in separate subqueries.
- For trigger events, use explicit recency language and search for funding, hiring, partnerships, launches, expansion, regulation, incidents, and leadership changes.
- Prioritize official company pages, newsroom posts, customer stories, product pages, investor or press pages, credible news, job postings, and relevant executive profiles.
- Treat LinkedIn-style profile snippets, unsourced lists, and old syndicated pages as lower confidence.
- Report failed or inaccessible sources when they affect trigger events, official pages, customer evidence, or buyer context.

## Output Template

Use this markdown structure and keep it practical:

```markdown
# Account Brief: <company>

## Account Snapshot
- What they do:
- Size/market/geography:
- Relevant products or business lines:

## Trigger Events
- <event>: <why it matters> ([source](URL))

## Business Priorities And Likely Pain Points
- Priority:
- Evidence:
- Sales relevance:

## Buyer And Executive Context
- Person/team:
- Relevant context:
- Confidence:

## Outreach Angles
- Angle:
- Supporting evidence:
- Discovery question:

## Source Gaps
- <missing or uncertain item>
```

Keep claims practical. Do not invent budget, intent, internal priorities, or buyer names when sources do not support them.
