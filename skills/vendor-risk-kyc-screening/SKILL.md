# Vendor Risk KYC Screening

## Execution

Use the bundled [Tavily CLI setup](../tavily-cli/SKILL.md) and load only the
endpoint skill needed: [search](../tavily-search/SKILL.md),
[extract](../tavily-extract/SKILL.md), [map](../tavily-map/SKILL.md),
[crawl](../tavily-crawl/SKILL.md), or [research](../tavily-research/SKILL.md).
For the connected MCP tools, use [tavily-mcp](../tavily-mcp/SKILL.md).

## Workflow

Use search and extract for source-grounded vendor, merchant, supplier, counterparty, and KYC research; use map or crawl only for known official directories or registries. Treat this as research support, not a final compliance determination. Execution mechanics should come from companion endpoint skills.

Treat the guidance below as base guidance; adapt it to the user's request when appropriate.

- Identify the entity, aliases, parent/subsidiaries, executives, jurisdictions, products, and risk categories.
- Break the screen into short subqueries under 400 characters for each alias and risk type: sanctions, enforcement, litigation, regulatory warning, recall, adverse media, cybersecurity incident, supplier risk, and jurisdiction.
- Use exact-match style queries for legal names, people, product names, and phrases that must appear verbatim.
- Search first, then filter by domain trust and source type before extracting. Prioritize official regulators, sanctions lists, court records, recall databases, company disclosures, and credible news.
- Extract selected sources that can support or rule out specific findings.
- Use site navigation only when a known regulator, registry, or company site needs URL discovery.
- Collect multiple pages only for scoped official directories, recalls/advisories, policy pages, or supplier/product pages.

## Research Budget

- Start with a small focused search set covering entity aliases, sanctions/regulatory risk, adverse media, and jurisdiction-specific risk.
- Extract only the strongest official or credible sources before drafting.
- Add more searches only for named gaps, such as missing alias coverage, missing jurisdiction coverage, or unresolved high-risk findings.
- Do not use map unless a known regulator, registry, sanctions portal, or company site has specific buried pages to locate.
- Do not use crawl unless the user asks for scoped collection from an official directory, registry, recalls page, or supplier/product section.

## Capability Guidance

- Use search for most vendor screening, KYC, adverse media, sanctions, enforcement, litigation, recall, and supplier-risk discovery.
- Use extract on selected official records, regulator pages, sanctions pages, court records, recall databases, company disclosures, and credible news.
- Use map for official registries, regulator sites, sanctions portals, or company domains with hard-to-find pages.
- Use crawl for directories or official record sets only after narrowing the paths and risk categories.
- Use research for full due diligence reports, then verify high-impact claims against original sources.

## Query And Source Guidance

- Query legal names, trade names, aliases, parent/subsidiary names, executives, product names, and jurisdiction terms separately.
- Combine entity terms with specific risk concepts: sanctions, enforcement action, consent order, lawsuit, fraud, recall, breach, warning letter, import alert, debarment, bankruptcy, and adverse media.
- Prioritize regulators, sanctions databases, court systems, recall databases, official registries, company disclosures, and credible news.
- Treat unsourced aggregators, copied press releases, and name-match-only hits as low confidence until corroborated.
- Report failed or inaccessible sources when they affect official registries, sanctions pages, or high-risk findings.

## Output Template

Use this markdown structure and avoid implying clearance:

```markdown
# Vendor / KYC Risk Brief: <entity>

## Scope
- Entity and aliases checked:
- Jurisdictions:
- Risk categories:
- Source coverage limits:

## Findings
### High
- Finding:
- Evidence:
- Confidence:

### Medium
- Finding:
- Evidence:
- Confidence:

### Low / Watch
- Finding:
- Evidence:
- Confidence:

## No Relevant Findings In Searched Sources
- <risk category or alias checked>

## Recommended Next Checks
- <next check>

## Sources
- [Source title](URL) - <what it supports>
```

Say "no relevant findings found in searched sources" instead of "cleared" unless the user supplied authoritative internal checks.
